# VBA-Challenge
VBA Module - Challenge 2

For this assignment, I received some tutoring in the concepts from a colleague at work. Tom Huang was able to help me better understand the looping and if/else conditional principles. I wrote the code but when I encountered an error, Tom helped me identify what the problem was and made sure I understood how to fix it.

For code lines 38, 39, 57 I used snippets of code from an example in class - the CreditCardChecker-CellComparison file.

For formatting code on lines 67, 80, and 129 I used examples found on Stack Overflow as a guide.

Lastly, for the WorksheetFunction.Index operations, I found examples on scales.arabpsychology.com/stats. I used those examples of code as guide to write the functions into my VBS code.

Thank you!
